# Fish(sweeper)
### by Alex Yoshida, Emily Hu and Shannon Cui
An IOS mobile memory game inspired by Minesweeper where you try to catch fish and avoid bombs!
More bombs are added each day and fish increase in value.
Advance to the next day only if you survive the previous day and memorize the bombs correctly ;)
